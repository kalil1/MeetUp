# Meetup
This application was made to help connect athletes and local sport. Using geolocation to find a users longitude & latitude, it allows users to host a sport/game of their choice at a public park or playground within 15 miles of their location. Once a user post the sport/game other users within a given radius will see the game and have the option to join and play
